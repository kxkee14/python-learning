i think the guy in the youtube video whose showing me how to code made a mistake
there is no "elif" function for the C Grade. As you can see in his code, it would be
technically impossible to obtain a C grade without another "elif" function.
in the picture above, i added my correction compared to his code.

please correct me if im wrong, im new at learning python
thank you
